# Face Mask Detection

## Introduction

With the ongoing global pandemic, the use of face masks has become crucial in preventing the spread of respiratory diseases. The Face Mask Detection project leverages Convolutional Neural Network (CNN) technology to automatically identify whether an individual is wearing a face mask or not. This project aids in enforcing safety protocols in public spaces and contributes to overall public health.

## About the Project

The Face Mask Detection project utilizes a CNN model trained on the Face Mask Dataset sourced from Kaggle. The model demonstrates significant accuracy, achieving 90.74% on the training set and 92.19% on the testing set over 5 epochs. The project provides a reliable solution for real-time face mask detection, enabling businesses and public spaces to ensure compliance with safety measures.

## Train-Test Split

The dataset is divided into training and testing sets using a standard train-test split methodology. This ensures the model's ability to generalize to new, unseen data. The split is performed with a ratio of 80% for training and 20% for testing, maintaining the balance between the two classes (with mask and without mask).

## Predictive System

The Face Mask Detection project includes a simple and user-friendly predictive system. Users can input the path of an image, and the trained CNN model will make predictions, determining whether the person in the image is wearing a mask or not. This predictive system enhances the practicality of the project for various applications.

## Dependencies

The project is implemented in Python and relies on several libraries and packages:

- Python 3.x
- NumPy
- Pandas
- Scikit-learn
- TensorFlow
- OpenCV
- Matplotlib
- PIL (Pillow)

Make sure to install these dependencies before running the project code.

## Conclusion

The Face Mask Detection project is an impactful application of deep learning in the context of public health. By automating face mask detection, the project contributes to the global efforts to mitigate the spread of infectious diseases. The high accuracy achieved during training and testing demonstrates the effectiveness of the implemented CNN model, making it a reliable tool for real-world scenarios.
